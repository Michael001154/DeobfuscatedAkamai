# DeobfuscatedAkamai
Deobfuscated scripts for Akamai
# Why create this repo?
To make reverse engineering Akamai easier for new people
# How did you deobfuscate the source?
Akamai is a simpler anti bot as a public website/program can be used to deobfuscate the source this tool is called de4js you just pull the source from the websites sources and then pass the raw text to de4js and click array and most of the time it will deobfuscate the script and replace the array call indexes with the values for you
# This repo won't have every single Akamai script out there just a couple that i know of and can deobfuscate
# I will add the scripts once i am done with another project
